Steps:-
1. Clone the repo
2. run npm install to download necessary dependencies
3. run node server.js to start server
4. An example 'reportDetails' object is created in server.js file to check if API is working. Make a POST request using Postman or through Firefox(by manually changing GET request into a POST request.)
5. We will recieve the Success response after that which means our database has stored the provided details. Change the 'reportDetails' accordingly to check various cases.
6. Now we can make GET requests using the reportID quesry parameters  to recieve all required details about the report(using POSTMAN or any browser).
